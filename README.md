# Abp.io Entity Creator

This tool allows you to create new entities for solutions made with abp.io framework.

Its use is very simple and similar to the [AbpHelper (CLI) tool](https://github.com/EasyAbp/AbpHelper.CLI), with the difference that it is not necessary to model the entity in the solution and it also has a more friendly UI.

## How to Use

Run the application, enter the folder where your apb.io application is located.

Fill in the name of the entity and its properties.
